## Few challenges i've invented in order to improve my Pythonic skills :)

Those challs come as Jupyter Notebooks and make use a few libs...

#### Coding Python Efficiently

* [Writing efficient loops](https://github.com/obrunet/Python-Programming-Efficiently/blob/master/2019_03_27_writing_efficient_loops_in_python.ipynb)
* [Compare C vs Python](https://github.com/obrunet/Python-Programming-Efficiently/blob/master/2019_03_28_compare_C_and_python.ipynb)
* [List Comprehension / Generators](https://github.com/obrunet/Python-Programming-Efficiently/blob/master/2019_03_29.list_comprehension_generators.ipynb)
